# assessment2

[I have indicated my steps taken in the word document]

Question 2 (Optional): 
1.	Provision a simple Function (in Cloud Service Provider) to return the same response as what this API returns https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to your default virtual network in your personal cloud account using Terraform or other IaC.  The preferred language for Function is Python or JavaScript. 

If you don't have experience with Terraform or other IaC, you can create this Function manually by listing down all the steps and providing screenshots of the source code and execution result.

2.	Create a new project on GitLab/GitHub called "assessment2" and push your code or steps & screenshots to this project. Please ensure you do not commit any sensitive information such as your credentials, keys, secrets, etc.

3.	Once you have completed the above, please share the project link with us.
